# Roll-a-ball-in-space

For educational purposes only. I followed one of the basic tutorials of Unity3D and built a number of features on top of it.

For now the feature set is quite limited, but I intend to add more functionality in the near future.

Current features:

1. Five Levels with increasing difficulty
2. Background music that set the right rhythm!
3. Countdowns that show the time left to complete each Level
4. Several obstacles that automatically disqualify the user when they are triggered
5. Now it's possible to jump!

Hope you enjoy it!
